## About the test
Based on the Measurement Instrument Database for the Social Sciences
http://www.midss.org/content/reading-mind-eyes-test
* Author of Tool: 
	Baron-Cohen, S. Jolliffe, T. Mortimore, C. and Robertson, M.
* Primary use / Purpose:
	The task involves describing the emotional/mental state of a person based on only an image of their eyes, in a fixed-choice paradigm.
* Psychometrics: 
Validity was discussed in Baron-Cohen, S. Wheelwright, S. and Hill, J. (2001). 
Test-retest reliability was examined in Adams, R.B., Rule, N.O., Franklin, R.G., Wang,E., Stevenson,M.T.,Yoshikawa, S.,et al. (2011),
where it was detremined that the score found should be treated as an approximation.

## First Appearance
* The test first appeared in the book "The essential Difference": 
>Simon Baron-Cohen¸ The Essential Difference: Male and Female Brains and the Truth about Autism. Basic Books: 2003.

##Other studies and papers

* prof. Krzysztof Gajos, Maxwell Dworkin 251, 33 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138, kgajos@seas.harvard.edu
He did the test in order to understand how the ability to recognize emotions of others vary across cultures
Use 37 pictures showing just the eyes part of people's face
with a duration of approximately 10 minutes
* Cross-cultural reading the mind in the eyes: an fMRI investigation 
Adams Jr, R. B., Rule, N. O., Franklin Jr, R. G., Wang, E., Stevenson, M. T., Yoshikawa, S.,& Ambady, N. (2010). Cross-cultural reading the mind in the eyes: an fMRI investigation. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 22(1), 97-108.
According this paper: 
	"the RME is a social–perceptual test of mental state reasoning that shows convergent validity with social–cognitive tests of
	theory of mind, and has been demonstrated in numerous studies to reliably differentiate nonclinical samples 
	from clinical samples who exhibit certain psychopathologic disorders and brain damage associated with impaired
	social perception, such as autism spectrum disorders (e.g., Baron-Cohen et al., 1999) and amygdalotomy"
They provide a revision of 10 studies which used RME test, principally to evaluate:
lesions on the amigdala, frontal lobe. (more accurate with lesions)
syndromes of autism, asperger,schizophrenia
(fRMI=functional magnetic resonance imaging)
* The “Reading the Mind in the Eyes” Test  Complete Absence of Typical Sex Difference in ~400 Men and Women with Autism
Baron-Cohen, S., Bowen, D. C., Holt, R. J., Allison, C., Auyeung, B., Lombardo, M. V., ... & Lai, M. C. (2015). The “reading the mind in the eyes” test: complete absence of typical sex difference in~ 400 men and women with autism. PloS one, 10(8), e0136521.
They use a Two-way ANOVA to confirm a significant sex difference between control males and females  and a absence of a sexdifference between males and females with autism
* The ‘‘Reading the Mind in the Eyes’’ Test Revised Version: A Study with Normal Adults, and Adults with Asperger Syndrome or High-functioning Autism
Baron‐Cohen, S., Wheelwright, S., Hill, J., Raste, Y., & Plumb, I. (2001). The “Reading the Mind in the Eyes” test revised version: A study with normal adults, and adults with Asperger syndrome or high‐functioning autism. Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, 42(2), 241-251.ISO 690	
There are two simple modifications we can make to the test to remedy these three limitations: increase the number of items in the test, and increase the number of
response options on each trial. In the revised version of the test reported in this paper, we have made both of these
modifications: the total number of items (photographs) is increased from 25 to 36, and the number of response 
options (forced-choice words) is increased from 2 to 4 per trial. This means that chance is p¯ ±25 per trial, and that
one only needs to score 13 or above, out of 36, to be performing significantly above chance (Binomial Test).
In effect, this provides a bigger window of 24 points (from 13–36) in which to be able to reveal individual differences
in ability on this test. It also decreases the risk of normal performance approaching the ceiling of the test
##Conclusion
* all studies use the 36 pictures
