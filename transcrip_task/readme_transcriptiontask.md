	* Results: The labor supply curves slope upwards after subjects perform an additional transcription
	task for p cents(where p was equal to 1, 5, 15 or 25 cents)in exchange for a randomly determined wage.
	The subjects should perform a rather tedious but well-paid transcription task first (for 30 cents),
	* The advantages of a text transcription task are that it (a) is tedious, (b) requires effort and attention,
	and (c) has a clearly defined quality measure—namely, the number of errors made by subjects (if the true text is known).

*Measuring Errors in Text Entry Tasks:An Application of the Levenshtein String Distance Statistic

	* The algorithm yields the minimum distance between two strings defined in terms of editing primitives. 
	The primitives are insertion, deletion, and substitution. Given two character strings, the idea is to find the smallest set of 
	primitives that applied to one string produces the other. The number of primitives in the set is the minimum string distance 
	(MSD).
	
*An Experiment on Time Preference and Misprediction in Unpleasant Tasks

> Augenblick, N., & Rabin, M. (2015). An Experiment on Time Preference and Misprediction in Unpleasant Tasks (pp. 1067-1115). Working 
> paper.
	* Paper objective: investigate the time-inconsistent taste for immediate gratification
	and future-preference misprediction.
	* Results: participants wished to complete 4-12% fewer tasks when decisions were elicited right after completing tasks than 
	before.
	* Method: Each date (for seven days over a subsequent six-week period), participants chose how many unpleasant transcription tasks 
	(between 0 and 100) that they wished to complete for 5 randomly chosen piece-rate wages (between $0.01 and $0.31)
	in the present and on a selection of future dates
* Working Over Time: Dynamic Inconsistency in Real Effort Tasks

> Augenblick, N., Niederle, M., & Sprenger, C. (2013). Working over time: Dynamic inconsistency in real effort tasks (No. w18734). 
> National Bureau of Economic Research.
	* Objective: estimate individual parameters of dynamic inconsistency
	* Method: introduce a seven week longitudinal experimental design asking subjects to allocate and subsequently
	reallocate units of e↵ort over time at various gross interest rates.
	* Two jobs: First one a transcription task, Second one is a tetris completation game.
