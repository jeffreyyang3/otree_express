    <h4> General Instructions </h4>

    <p> Welcome to the LEEPS Laboratory. During the course of this session, you will be asked to make a series of decisions. By participating in this study, you will earn real money that will be paid to you in cash at the end of the experiment. On top of what you earn during the session, you will receive a participation fee of {{ participation_fee }}.</p>

<p> It is important you do not speak out loud, laugh or talk to other participants during the duration of the session. We expect and appreciate your cooperation. If you have any question, please raise your hand and an experimenter will attend to you. After you have read these instructions, you will answer a few brief questions to ensure you understand them.</p><br/>

<h4>Stages</h4>

<p>This session consists of two stages. In Stage 1, called <em>Task Stage</em>, you will work on a set of tasks to earn money. We will refer to the earned amount as the <em>task income</em>. Specific instructions for these tasks will be provided once Stage 1 starts.</p>

{#  Stage 2: general | All but TP #}
{% if treatment != 'TP' %}

    <p> In Stage 2, called <em>Interaction Stage</em>, you will interact with another participant in the room. First, you will be anonymously paired with one another. You will then be randomly assigned to be either of <strong><em>Role A</em></strong> or of <strong><em>Role B</em></strong>. You will remain in the same role throughout the entire duration of the experiment. You will be informed about your role on your computer screen once Stage 2 starts. You will not be informed about the identity of the person you are paired with, neither during nor after the experiment. </p> </br>

    <h4> Role A:</h4>
    <p> If you are assigned <em>Role A</em>, you are to decide how much of B’s <em>task income</em> you would like to transfer into your own account. You are able to transfer anywhere from 0 to 100 percent of B’s <em>task income</em>, but you will not be able to transfer B’s endowment. The image below shows the screen where you will make your decision: </p> </br>

        </div> </br>

    <h4> Role B:</h4>
    <p> If you are assigned <em>Role B</em>, you will be asked to guess what percentage of your <em>task income</em> A will transfer to his/her own account.</p>

{% endif %}



{#    Stage 2: general | only TP #}
{% if treatment  == 'TP' or role == 'TP-R' %}

    <p> In Stage 2, called <em>Interaction Stage</em>, there are three possible roles for each participant, <em>Role A</em>, <em>Role B</em> and <em>Role R</em>. First, one participant will be randomly assigned <em>Role R</em>. The rest of participants will be anonymously paired in groups of two. Within each group, roles will be randomly assigned so that there will be one person in <em>Role A</em> and one in <em>Role B</em>. You will remain in the same role throughout the entire duration of the experiment, and will be informed about your role on your computer screen once Stage 2 starts. You will not be informed about the identity of the person you are paired with, neither during nor after the experiment.</p>

    <h4> Role R: </h4>
    <p> If you are assigned <em>Role R</em> (Reader) your only task is to read the messages written by participants in <em>Role B</em> who are able to send a message to you. The Reader is the only participant that is going to read these messages. None of the other participants in today's session will ever read them. The Reader will not receive any information about participants of Roles A or B. After reading the messages, the Reader will confirm having read them.</p>

    <h4> Role A:</h4>
    <p> If you are assigned <em>Role A</em>, you are to decide how much of B’s <em>task income</em> you would like to transfer into your own account. You are able to transfer anywhere from 0 to 100 percent of B’s <em>task income</em>, but you will not be able to transfer B’s endowment.

    <h4> Role B:</h4>
    <p> If you are assigned <em>Role B</em>, you will be asked to guess what percentage of your <em>task income</em> the participant in <em>Role A</em> will transfer to his/her own account.</p>
